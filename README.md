# Auth Project

## Walkthrough

* https://vimeo.com/701510267/8fb7f4659b

## Features: 

* Sign up
* Login (CSV data is stored in DB view helper methods)
* Logout
* Prevent from visiting unintended routes (e.g. should not show login-form when logged-in)
* Error (Incorrect username/password, username already exists, warn from submitting empty form, etc)

## Tech:
* Ruby on Rails project (Ruby v 2.5.1)
* Postgres for DB
* Utilized Ruby's CSV Api to read data into Ruby model and persist it
* Used Active Record within Rails framework to perform CRUD operations with data (DB)

## More features can be added ...
* We can allow each user to upload their favorite photo as their wallpaper (Image can be stored in AWS S3 or in DB via Active Storage Blobs)
* We can allow users to update their info (straightforward form + Users.update method (which is already implemented, just missing the form in HomePage)

## In Progress
* Deploy this project to heroku
